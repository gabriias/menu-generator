The idea here is to create a menu generator, where the user will enter the item and the price and will be able to download the generated image, already in the standard size for the Instagram storie.

This is being built following the voices in my head (lol), and as I had no idea how to transform a div into an image, the basis came from [DBins blog](https://blog.dbins.com.br/exportar-html-para-imagem-com-javascript "DBins blog") and the library [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/ "html2canvas") is being used.
